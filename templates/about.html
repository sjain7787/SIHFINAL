    <p style="text-align: justify; ">Maritime Transport is a critical infrastructure for the social and economic
        development of a country. It influences
        the pace, structure and pattern of development. The Ministry of Ports,Shipping and Waterways encompasses within
        its
        fold ports,shipping and waterways sectors which include Shipbuilding and Ship-repair, Major Ports, National
        Waterways, and Inland Water Transport.

        Ministry of Ports,Shipping and Waterways has been entrusted with the responsibility to formulate policies and
        programmes on these subjects and their implementation. A comprehensive policy package is necessary to address
        the
        diverse issues facing the Maritime transport sector.

        The capacity of the ports in terms of their berths and cargo handling equipment needs to be vastly improved to
        cater
        to the growing requirements of the overseas trade.The Ports,Shipping and Waterways industry needs to be enabled
        to
        carry higher shares of the sea-borne trade in indigenous bottoms. Historically, investment in the transport
        sector,
        particularly in the ports, have been made by the States mainly because of the large volume of resources
        required,
        long gestation periods, uncertain returns and various externalities, both positive and negative, associated with
        this infrastructure.</p>
